Cold stratification for interior spruce (Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Tree Seed Centre Internal Document): 

•	fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 24 hours in a plastic bag or vial.  
•	drain and surface dry at room temperature until free water has evaporated, and seed moves freely.
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange.
•	place in the refrigerator for 21 days at 2-5 degrees C.
•	monitor seed during cold stratification to ensure it doesn't dry out, rot or germinate early.
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown.


Cold stratification for subalpine fir (Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Tree Seed Centre Internal Document):

•	To prepare Abies for sowing, we use a "cold stratification procedure": 
•	fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 48 hours in a plastic bag or vial.  
•	drain of free water.  
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange.
•	provide a cold stratification in the refrigerator for 56 days at 2-5 degrees C
•   monitor seed during cold stratification to ensure it doesn't dry out, rot or germinate early.
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown.

Germinants Methods:

Once the seeds have been cold stratified, they will be placed in a flat with sterile potting mix and placed in a growth chamber for three weeks at 17.5 degrees C, 24hrs in the dark and 50% relative humidity and ambient carbon dioxide conditions. A three-week germination period is based on standard seed testing trials (Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany). Further both genera---Abies and Picea---were shown to have a higher germination percentage in a dark treatment compared to a light treatment (Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany). Since most seeds benefit from variable temperatures while germinating (see. Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany and Hansen & Leiusson. 2008. Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research), we decided to germinate seeds in 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C for 12 hours each day, this was chosen as the average temperature between the two---17.5 degrees---represents the median value of both of our temperature treatments. 50% relative humidity was chosen as it reflects the median value of similar studies (see. Grossnickle & Fan. 1999. Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research and Landhausser et al. 2001. Canadian Journal of Forest Research). Seeds will be kept in ambient carbon dioxide levels- 400 ppm as we aren't testing the effect of carbon dioxide levels on seed germination (Navidad et al. 2020. Agronomy). Seeds will be watered until they are moist every three days (CFIA, methods and procedures for testing seed). After three weeks, I will put germinated seedlings into pots for experimental manipulation. Germination is defined for both species at the point the protruding radical is equal in size to seed coat (Anderson and Winteron, 1996, American Journal of Botany).

Soil Methods: 

I will sift soil collected from Alex Fraser---the sieve will have a minimum of 1-cm between rings---this is to get rid of any rocks or other unwanted materials from the soil (Packer & Clay. 2000. Letters to Nature). Large roots will be cut to ensure they fit through the sieve. After I have filtered the soil, I will return the soil to their respective buckets. A separate sieve will be used for each respective species' soils. I will also sift the sterile potting mix. Once I have filtered all the soil, I will autoclave half of all the soil at 121 degrees Celsius for an hour. Field collected soil will be autoclaved for an addition hour after a 48 hour break. After each round of autoclaving the soil samples will be allowed to air out in a fume hood for an hour. To ensure that soil is sterile I will take four random soil samples from each soil type---sterilized fir soil, sterilized spruce soil, unsterilized fir soil, unsterilized spurce soil, and the sterilized potting mix---and spread it on a potato dextrose agar plate in a fume hood to minimize contamination from air particles. After 72 hours I will compare the potatoe dextrose agar plates to ensure that sterilized soil have less microorganisms present than unsterilized soil. If further autoclaving is needed then the respective samples will be put in the autoclave for an additional hour at 121 degrees Celcius. This will give me my sterilized treatments. I will put equally weighed amounts of potting mix and soil collected from Alex Fraser together in each pot. Anytime soil is being handled, I will wear gloves to avoid cross-contamination.

Experimental methods: 

Once seeds have germinated and the soil is ready, I will weigh the seedlings for the initial biomass measurement. Once I have weighed the seedlings, I will put the seedlings into their pots for the rest of the experiment. I will label each seedling with a toothpick, this will ensure we are getting biomass values for the same seedling before and after the experiment. Both species tend to be sown less than a centimeter deep in soil (https://www.mountroyalseeds.com/). This experiment has 16 treatments (see treatments above) in total, and I will label each pot using duct tape and a sharpie with the respective treatment, replicate number, and species. I will randomize the layout of the pots. I will separate each treatment-based temperature; for example, I will set one out of the two growth chambers to 10 degrees C. In contrast, I will set the other growth chambers to 25 degrees C. Within each respective chamber, sterilized and unsterilized treatments will be kept in seperate flats to avoid cross-contamination. Both chambers will be set at 50% relative humidity and ambient carbon dioxide conditions- 400 ppm. A hobo logger will be placed inside both of the chambers to measure temperature data. The growth chamber will be set to a 12-hour day and 12-hour night photoperiod (Chiang et al. 2018. Forests and Webber et al. 2005. Tree Physiology). During the 12-hour day photoperiod all of the LED bulbs will be turned on- this reflects 1000umoles/m2/s of photosynthecially active radiation. The fan speed for both the day and night setting will be set to 85%.  I will change the temperature of the growth chambers and move pots across chambers every three weeks to avoid chamber bias (Kueppers et al. 2017. Forests). Further, I will rotate pot position---every week---to account for any possible spatial differences within a growth chamber (Landhauser et al. 2001. Canadian Journal of Forest Research). I will water each pot every two days until moist (CFIA, methods and procedures for testing seed). I will take soil moisture readings weekly of a random subset of pots---40 pots per growth chamber---to determine if pots watering needs to be modified. If soil mositure readings are taken on the same day that watering has taken place, I will wait a minimum of two hours between the two to ensure readings are not confounded. At the end of the experiment, I will reweigh each seedling to find out the final biomass. I will also measure and record height---from the bottom of the stem to the top of foliage---of seedlings each week (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013. Australian Journal of Botany). I will take height measurements based on the greatest extent of a seedling's foliage even if the foliage is in a relaxed position. Finally, I will measure the dried above and below ground biomass of seedlings once they have been put in a drying oven at 70 degrees C for 72 hours (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013. Australian Journal of Botany).

Labelling System: 

Will go in alphabetical order of treatments: Density(High or low), Soil treatment (Con or Het), Soil Type (Ster or Unster) and Temperature (High or Low). Each treatment will be seperated by a dash. After the treatment the species name will be written next (fir or spruce) followed by replicate number. Each treatment should have ten replicates and we should have a total of 320 pots.
