Autoclave Soil Methods

To request autoclave room access please email: natasha.thompson@ubc.ca

Soil samples should be split into maximum one liter bags to prevent overfilling. Sterile soil only has to be autoclaved once however to ensure complete sterilization of field collected soil you should autoclave twice - with a two/three day interval in between. To ensure complete sterilization you can test that there are no micro-organisms present in the sample by spreading the sample on a potato dextrose agar lined petri dish and leaving it for 3-5 days. 

Autoclaveable plastic bags can be found under the sink in the autoclave room. When using soil, it is best to double bag to prevent spillage. There is no need to book the autoclave but you may leave a note on it saying you are using for a short defined period - under two weeks. 

Ensure the autoclave has sufficent water, you have to use the dionized water in the autoclave room but don't have to log how much you used. The dionized water should not be filled past the bottom plate in the autoclave. The autoclave has three cages which can each fit three soil sample bags. 

To ensure quick use of the autoclave, make sure to turn it on before use as it needs a warm up period of 5-10 minutes similar to preheating an oven. It is always best not to overfill samples but rather use the autoclave more times if needed. This is especially true as soil is a pain to clean from the autoclave. 

Once the soil samples have been autoclaved, it is best to let them air out---without opening the autoclave bag---in a fume hood for up to an hour.
